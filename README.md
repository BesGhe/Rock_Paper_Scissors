# Rock_Paper_Scissors

Logic

- Compare each turn, who wins rock vs paper, scissors vs rock, etc
- option to taunt after each turn
- number per choice
- ask each player each turn
- hidden choices?
- multiple taunts?
- continue with best 2/3...3/5...etc.
- tie? rethrow turn .equals to ==
- quit option
- scoreboard, counting
